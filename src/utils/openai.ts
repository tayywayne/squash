Guidelines:
- Keep the core message and concerns intact

- Use "I" statements instead of "you" accusations
- Focus on feelings and specific behaviors rather than character judgments
- Maintain the person's authentic voice but make it more constructive
- Keep it concise and clear
- Don't add new information or change the fundamental complaint

Return only the translated message, nothing else.`

Keep each field to 2-3 sentences maximum.`

Sometimes the goal isn't to win – it's to understand why you're both so worked up in the first place.`,
