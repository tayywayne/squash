# SquashCred Points System

SquashCred is Squashie's virtual currency and reputation system. It rewards positive conflict resolution behaviors and penalizes negative ones, creating a gamified incentive structure.

## Technical Implementation

The SquashCred system is implemented through several database tables and functions:

### Tables

- **user_points**: Stores current point balance
  - `user_id` (uuid, PK): References auth.users(id)
  - `squashcred` (int): Current point balance
  - `updated_at` (timestamp): Last update time

- **squashcred_events**: Audit log for point transactions
  - `id` (uuid, PK): Unique identifier
  - `user_id` (uuid): References auth.users(id)
  - `amount` (int): Points awarded/deducted
  - `reason` (text): Explanation for transaction
  - `created_at` (timestamp): When occurred

### Database Functions

```sql
-- Function to award or deduct SquashCred points
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.award_squashcred(
  p_user_id uuid,
  p_amount int,
  p_reason text
)
RETURNS int AS $$
DECLARE
  current_points int;
  new_points int;
BEGIN
  -- Get current points or create record if doesn't exist
  INSERT INTO user_points (user_id, squashcred)
  VALUES (p_user_id, 0)
  ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING;
  
  SELECT squashcred INTO current_points
  FROM user_points
  WHERE user_id = p_user_id;
  
  -- Calculate new points with constraints
  new_points := current_points + p_amount;
  new_points := GREATEST(-100, LEAST(100000, new_points));
  
  -- Update points
  UPDATE user_points
  SET squashcred = new_points,
      updated_at = now()
  WHERE user_id = p_user_id;
  
  -- Log the event (only if points actually changed)
  IF new_points != current_points THEN
    INSERT INTO squashcred_events (user_id, amount, reason)
    VALUES (p_user_id, new_points - current_points, p_reason);
  END IF;
  
  RETURN new_points;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### Application Implementation

The system is used throughout the application to reward and penalize user actions:

```typescript
// Award SquashCred for action
export const awardForAction = async (
  userId: string, 
  actionKey: keyof typeof SQUASHCRED_ACTIONS
): Promise<{ newBalance: number; error?: string }> => {
  const action = SQUASHCRED_ACTIONS[actionKey];
  return squashCredService.awardPoints(userId, action.points, action.reason);
}
```

## Display Components

SquashCred is displayed in several UI components:

1. **SquashCredDisplay**: Shows current balance and tier
   - Appears in header, profile, and other locations
   - Color-coded based on point value
   - Includes tier emoji and tooltip

2. **SquashCredHistory**: Transaction history
   - Shows recent point changes with reasons
   - Displays timestamps and amounts
   - Color-coded for gains and losses

## Achievement Integration

The SquashCred system integrates with the achievement system:

- **SquashCred Millionaire**: Unlocked at 10,000+ points
- **Negative Nancy**: Unlocked at -50 points
- **Comeback Story**: Going from negative to positive points

## Constraints and Limits

- Minimum points: -100
- Maximum points: 100,000
- Points are always integers
- Transactions are atomic and logged
