## 🧠 AI Conflict Mediation

Squashie uses AI to transform emotional, potentially inflammatory messages into constructive communication.

### Message Translation
- **Raw Input**: Users can express their frustrations honestly
- **AI Processing**: OpenAI transforms messages to be constructive while preserving core concerns
- **Privacy**: Raw messages are never shown to the other party

### Multi-Stage Resolution
1. **Initial Mediation**: AI provides a summary and suggestion
2. **Rehash Option**: If users aren't satisfied, AI offers a fresh perspective
3. **Core Issues**: Users can clarify their fundamental concerns
4. **Final Judgment**: If all else fails, Judge AI delivers a final ruling

## ⚖️ Judge AI Final Rulings

When conflicts can't be resolved through normal mediation:

- **Dramatic Verdicts**: Judge AI delivers theatrical, witty final rulings
- **Public Visibility**: Final judgments appear on the Public Shame Board

- **SquashCred Impact**: Voting and being voted on affects point balances
