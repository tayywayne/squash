## Achievement Tracking

Achievements are tracked through a combination of:

1. **Event-based triggers**: Direct actions like starting a conflict or voting
2. **Scheduled checks**: Time-based achievements like "Drama-Free Since..."
3. **Statistical analysis**: Achievements based on patterns like resolution rate
4. **Message analysis**: Communication style achievements

## Implementation

The achievement system is implemented through:

```typescript
// Check and unlock achievements based on context
checkAndUnlockAchievements: async (userId: string, context: {
  totalConflicts?: number;
  resolvedConflicts?: number;
  archetypeCount?: number;
  hasVotedOnConflict?: boolean;
  // ... many more context fields
}): Promise<string[]> => {
  const newAchievements: string[] = [];

  try {
    // Check first conflict
    if (context.totalConflicts === 1) {
      const { isNewAchievement } = await generalAchievementsService.unlockAchievement(userId, 'first_conflict');
      if (isNewAchievement) newAchievements.push('first_conflict');
    }

    // Check 5 conflicts
    if (context.totalConflicts === 5) {
      const { isNewAchievement } = await generalAchievementsService.unlockAchievement(userId, 'five_conflicts');
      if (isNewAchievement) newAchievements.push('five_conflicts');
    }

    // ... many more achievement checks
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error checking achievements:', error);
  }

  return newAchievements;
}
```

## Achievement Display

Achievements are displayed in several places:

1. **Toast Notifications**: Real-time popups when achievements are unlocked
2. **Profile Page**: Grid of unlocked achievements with tooltips
3. **Other User Profiles**: View achievements of other users

## Technical Implementation

Achievements are stored in the `user_achievements` table with:
- `user_id`: The user who earned the achievement
- `code`: Unique achievement identifier
- `name`: Display name
- `emoji`: Visual representation
- `description`: Explanation text
- `unlocked_at`: Timestamp when earned

The system uses database functions and application logic to check for and unlock achievements based on user actions and statistics.
