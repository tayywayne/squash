/*
  # Create Conflict Confidence Quests System

  1. New Tables
    - `quests` - Stores quest metadata (title, description, rewards)
    - `quest_steps` - Stores individual steps for each quest
    - `user_quests` - Tracks user progress on quests
    - `user_quest_steps` - Stores user responses to individual steps

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for appropriate access control
