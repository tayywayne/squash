# 🧃 Squashie

**Resolve drama. Earn achievements. Avoid total social collapse.**  
Squashie is a chaotic-good web app that helps users resolve conflicts with friends, roommates, coworkers, Reddit trolls, and themselves — using AI mediation, public voting (and shaming), emotional archetypes, and just enough petty sarcasm to stay fun.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **AI Conflict Mediation**  
  Translate angry vent fueled messages into thoughtful ones (because "you always do this" never ends well).

- ⚖️ **Judge AI Final Rulings**  
  When multiple resolutions fail, the AI lays down the law. Publicly.

- 🎭 **Conflict Archetypes**  
  Discover your inner Chaos Diplomat or Rehasher and collect them all.

- 🏆 **Achievements & Leaderboards**  
  Be the most emotionally evolved… or the most problematic. Either way, you'll rank.

- 📬 **Conflict Invites**  
  Invite others to your beef via email — whether they asked for it or not.

- 💸 **Supporter Tips & Badges**  
  Show the world (and your profile) that you care — with flair.

- 🗞️ **Reddit Conflict of the Day**  
  Real posts. Real drama. Real public voting on who's the problem.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **AI:** OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/4), custom prompt workflows
- **Email:** SendGrid for transactional emails
- **Payments:** Stripe Checkout
- **UI Components:** Custom components with Lucide React icons
- **Deployment:** Netlify

## ⚖️ Public Shame Board

The **Public Shame Board** is where unresolved conflicts go to die — or be judged.

If two users can't reach a resolution through Squashie's AI-assisted stages (and the rehashes fail too), the conflict is escalated to a **Final AI Judgment**. Once judged, it's posted publicly for the rest of the community to review, laugh at, and vote on.

Conflict is messy. The Public Shame Board keeps it honest, transparent, and just a little bit hilarious — because sometimes you really do need 30 strangers to tell you both were in the wrong.
